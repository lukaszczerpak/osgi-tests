This is a repository for my OSGi test bundles to test various use cases,
reproduce bugs, tracking regressions, ...

These basically exist for automatically finding regressions and/or new
bugs in basic OSGi frameworks like Apache Felix and/or in more
sophisticated environments like GlassFish 3.1+ which supports many of the
OSGi/JavaEE parts as of OSGi Service Platform Enterprise Specification.

Features (as of 2011-02-22):
* Uses TestNG
* Generic OSGi test support (abstract implementation)
* Apache Felix OSGi test support (incl. custom configurations)
* GlassFish 3.1 OSGi test support (based on Felix)

On my ToDo list currently:
* Enhance customizability of the GlassFish instance
* Add persistence test support (using Derby)
* Add more test bundles to verify the GlassFish runtime
